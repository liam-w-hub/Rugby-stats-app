## Project Description (1-2 pages):

### Description
Our goal for this project is to develop a mobile Android app that can be used by a user who is recording statistics of a rugby match. The statistics can be seen live by a different user, such as a coach who is not present at the game. We plan to record what event has occurred, where on the pitch it has occurred, which player was involved in the event, and the time that the event took place. 

The project is split between the mobile Android app, where the statistics can be entered by a user and viewed by others, the cloud for sending the new statistics, and the database where the statistics can be stored, updated, and displayed on the app.

The objective of this project is to create a cutting-edge Android mobile application that will simplify the gathering and evaluation of rugby match data. This app will enable users to enter real-time data during a game. Other users, such as coaches or players who might not be present at the game, will then be able to view the data live.

The application will closely monitor several important metrics, such as the frequency and spots on the field where the ball is lost, how the ball was lost, the overall amount of tackles made, turnovers, and particular plays that result in tries scored by the opposition. Teams will be able to evaluate performance and make data-driven decisions before, during, and after the game with this level of information.

In terms of user interface (UI), our design will prioritize simplicity and ease of use. The app will feature an intuitive layout that allows users to quickly navigate between different statistics. Large buttons and clear icons will enhance usability, ensuring that even users with minimal technical expertise can efficiently record data to avoid missing any game events. Live updates will be displayed in a visually engaging manner, utilizing graphs and charts to provide instant insights into team performance.

The project architecture incorporates a strong cloud infrastructure for real-time data synchronization to support these functions, guaranteeing that updates are immediately reflected across all linked devices. Users will be able to access previous data and create reports for post-match analysis thanks to a secure database that will handle statistics retrieval and storage.

### Division of Work
Our plan is to divide the work equally by splitting the app into two parts: the input data side and the visualizing data side. Liam will develop the input data side, where the user inputs the data of the match, while Lotanna will develop the visualization side of the application.

### Programming Language(s)
Java

### Programming Tool(s)
We intend to develop this app in Android Studio. For the database, we plan to use SQLite. The cloud service we chose to go with is Google Cloud.

### Learning Challenges
Although we have learned the Java programming language, this will be our first time using the Android Studio platform. This will also be the first time that we will use cloud-based synchronization to share data across devices.

### Hardware / Software Platform
We plan to develop this application on a PC for Android devices.
